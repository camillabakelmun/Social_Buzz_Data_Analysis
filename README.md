Accenture Job Simulation: Social Buzz Content Strategy
As part of my work on the Accenture Job Simulation, I had the opportunity to apply my data analytics and visualization skills to advise a social media client, Social Buzz, on their content creation strategy. Throughout the project, I worked on understanding business problems, cleaning and modeling data, and providing actionable insights through engaging visualizations.

Key Outcomes:

Analyzed the popularity of various content categories to determine the top 5 most engaging topics for Social Buzz.
Cleaned and merged multiple data sets to ensure accurate insights, identifying 16 unique categories and 15 types of reactions.
Created a series of data visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and a heatmap, to showcase the top content categories and user engagement patterns.
Presented my findings in a PowerPoint presentation, which I then recorded as a video for the client, summarizing the key insights and next steps.
Key Skills Developed:

Data Analysis & Modeling: Analyzed and cleaned large data sets, ensuring accurate results for actionable insights.
Data Visualization: Developed compelling visualizations to clearly communicate complex data.
Presentation Skills: Created and presented a professional PowerPoint presentation.
Storytelling with Data: Used data insights to create a narrative that resonates with business needs.
